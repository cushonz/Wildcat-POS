# Wildcat-POS

![alt_text](https://github.com/cushonz/Wildcat-POS/blob/main/pics/Wildcat%20spirit%20mark%20facing%20right2-cropped.png)

A simple point of sale system made to be used by [The Central Washington University Wildcat Shop](https://wildcatshop.net/) in place of the traditional POS in the event of an outage during offsite events.

I hope to expand on this and eventually create a user interface.

This project is written in C# using the .NET framework in an effort to keep the program portable, meaning nothing needs to be installed for this program to be run as long as the computer has .NET v2.0 or higher
