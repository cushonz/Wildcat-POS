information will be requested in the order 

SKU
price

all variations in SKU must be scanned in order for them to be considered "in the system", in the event that one is missed the cashier will be asked to input the desired price, so if some are missed its not a huge issue! if it is more conveniant this file can be made/modified directly in notepad as long as it follows the above convention and is named "inventory.txt"

Once you are done adding items to inventory input q/Q for SKU.

Duplicate SKUs could result in error or only the first result being considered,

SKU: 1234
price : 10
SKU1234:
price : 100

The resulting price would be 10.
